# Analysis-of-Amazon-Health-and-Personal-Care-Product-Reviews-for-Customer-Satisfaction
This is a group data analysis project from class BA820, spring 2025. Members include Jyun-Ru Huang, Pin-Hao Pan, Ruo-Rong Wang, and myself.

This project analyzes customer reviews from the Amazon Health and Personal Care category to uncover trends, customer behaviors, and sentiment patterns using exploratory data analysis, text processing, unsupervised clustering, and sentiment classification.

We specifically focused on analyzing the sentiment behind 3-star reviews to reveal the mixed sentiments underlying neutral ratings. Through text preprocessing, text mining, and text analysis, we explored common customer complaints and compliments. Additionally, we developed a sentiment prediction model applicable to unlabeled text data such as tweets or customer support chat logs, facilitating automated sentiment classification for businesses.
